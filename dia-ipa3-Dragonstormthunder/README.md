# WEEK11: Implementing Interaction

This assignment allows us to get familiar with implementing interactions in a WebXR-based application primarily using BabylonJS.

Your goal is to continue to build up more working experience using the BabylonJS framework. In particular, we will use differentiate code constructs (behaviours, actions and observables) to implement interactions on objects in a WebXR scene. You will also try to load a 3D model remotely from a URL, a common scenario you may encounter in a real-world application.

As with previous assignments, this should be a fairly straightforward exercise to complete as long as you read the test cases in detail. Do continue to make effort to understand every line of code and pick up any missing knowledge (e.g., observer design pattern) as necessary.

# Tasks to complete in this lab

We will do this assignment in the spirit of TDD (Test-Driven Development) as usual. So the tests are already written for you, and you will need to write the code to make the tests pass.

Same as before, the tests from the previous assignment are still there (with some minor file name updates). We continue to build on top of the previous assignment in an iterative fashion.

_(the text below is copied from the previous assignment)_
Do note that a proper TDD process in a "real" production team is much more than what we're doing here. If you wish to learn more about TDD, [Siggiqui's book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-test-driven-development/9781098106461/) may be a good read and is available in the SIT library. However, this DIA module is not focused on software engineering (SE), so we will leave this topic here.

## Testing

For testing, perform the usual:
- `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- `npm test` to run the test files

## Submission

For submission, it is similarly just a matter of committing (and pushing) your changes. The tests will be run automatically when you submit your solution.
