## Introduction

Well met, I'm Emma. I've been in love with programming since I was in primary school. My other loves are reading (books, manga, comics, magazines, anything I can get my hands on) and doing digital art.

I'm trying to learn pixel art and here's my five minute adventure in [Aesprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)!

2. Babylon.js API
3. Creating a narrative in our XR projects
